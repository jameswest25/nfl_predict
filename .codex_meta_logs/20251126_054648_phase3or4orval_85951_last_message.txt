PROGRESS: Blocked at pre-work checkpoint. `git add -A` still fails with “Unable to create .git/index.lock: Operation not permitted”. I also cannot write inside `.git` (e.g., `touch .git/test_write` fails). Because your instructions require staging/committing the current state before edits, I can’t proceed until `.git` is writable. Please adjust permissions or move the repo to a writable location and let me know when it’s ready.
