PROGRESS: Still blocked before edits. `git add -A` fails with “Unable to create '.git/index.lock': Operation not permitted”, and even `touch .git/tmp_test` is disallowed, indicating the `.git` directory is read-only in this environment. Working tree files are writable (e.g., `touch tmp_check` succeeds), but I can’t stage/commit as required. Please make `.git` writable or let me proceed without commits.
