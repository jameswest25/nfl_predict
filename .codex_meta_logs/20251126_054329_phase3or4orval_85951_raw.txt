Okay, great. Please work like an agent and implement the following plan in this repository.

    Here is the plan:

    <BEGIN_PLAN_START>
    **Overview and Priorities**

- **Priority 1: Labels and leakage** – Fix the “anytime TD” label semantics and harden leak‑guards so the model never sees post‑decision or same‑game realized stats.
- **Priority 2: Decision‑time realism for odds/injuries** – Make sure every feature (especially markets and injuries) is truly as‑of the configured decision cutoff and consistent at train vs inference.
- **Priority 3: Football‑grounded feature set** – Refine usage, role, drive/game‑state, and team context features to track the real mechanisms that drive TDs.
- **Priority 4: Cleanup of legacy/hallucinated structure** – Remove or fully implement dead paths (e.g., feature tuning CLI), MLB leftovers, and dangling assumptions.
- **Priority 5: Evaluation & monitoring** – Add tests, diagnostics, and calibration checks to guard against regressions and confirm football realism.

Below is a detailed, implementation‑ready plan organized by these priorities.

---

**Phase 1 – Clarify and Fix the Anytime TD Label**

**1.1 Decide label semantics (product decision)**  
(Non‑code but mandatory before implementation.)

- Choose between:
  - **Option A – “Offensive only”:** TDs where the player is the rusher or receiver (no passing, no returns).  
  - **Option B – “All non‑passing”:** TDs where the player is credited with any non‑passing TD (rush, receive, return, defensive scores).
- Align this choice with:
  - How books define “anytime TD scorer” in your markets.
  - Your analytics use‑cases (e.g., do you want WR/KR return TDs included?).
- Record the decision in:
  - A short design doc (label definition, edge cases, examples).
  - In‑code docs where the label is defined and in any config/README.

**1.2 Implement explicit label columns**

Goal: make label semantics explicit and non‑ambiguous.

- In the player‑game aggregation layer (e.g., `utils/feature/player_game_level.py`):
  - Define:
    - `anytime_td_offense = 1{rushing_td_count + receiving_td_count > 0}`
    - `anytime_td_all = 1{touchdowns > 0 and passing_td_count == 0}` (or equivalent explicit logic combining all non‑passing TD types).
  - Keep existing generic `touchdowns` and `passing_td_count`, but treat them as building blocks, not labels.
- Update any label construction helpers (e.g., `utils/feature/targets.py` or equivalent) to:
  - Reference these explicit columns instead of re‑deriving the logic ad hoc.
  - Make the target name (`label_anytime_td_offense` vs `label_anytime_td_all`) explicit.

**1.3 Wire labels into training configs**

- In the training pipeline (e.g., `pipeline/train.py`):
  - Introduce a configuration option for the problem definition, e.g.:
    - `label_name: anytime_td_offense` (default) or `anytime_td_all`.
  - Ensure:
    - Target derivation (`_derive_target_column` and any external source joins) uses the configured label column.
    - Downstream evaluation/reporting code (metrics, plots, CSV exports) read the same label.
- Add a brief warning in configs if you change the default semantics, to avoid silent breakage of existing analyses.

**1.4 Validate label correctness**

- Create a small label‑audit script/notebook that:
  - Samples games and players, printing:
    - Raw TD events (from PBP).
    - Aggregated TD counts (rush, receive, return, defensive, passing).
    - `anytime_td_offense` and `anytime_td_all`.
  - Check tricky edge cases:
    - QBs with rushing TDs.
    - WRs/RBs with fumble‑return or INT‑return TDs.
    - Special teams players (KR/PR specialists).
- Add a unit/integration test:
  - Build a tiny synthetic PBP frame with known TD types.
  - Assert the aggregated label columns match expected values.

**Risks / pitfalls**

- Changing label semantics will:
  - Break comparability with old offline analyses if not clearly versioned.
  - Potentially change model performance and calibration, especially for rare return/defensive TDs.
- Mitigation:
  - Version the label (e.g., `anytime_td_offense_v1`), and clearly log which version is used in each run.

---

**Phase 2 – Eliminate Data Leakage (Core Guardrails)**

**2.1 Inventory and classify leak‑prone columns**

- Build an introspection script around the feature matrix builder (e.g., in `pipeline/feature.py` + `pipeline/train.py`) that:
  - For each problem (`anytime_td`), captures:
    - Final training feature matrix column names.
    - Their groups/namespaces (odds, injury, PS, drive history, etc.).
  - Stores this schema snapshot to a simple artifact (e.g., JSON per run).
- Manually inspect and categorize:
  - **Definitely forbidden for training** (for anytime TD):
    - Any column referencing same‑game realized stats (e.g., `_ps_*_game`, `_game_stats`, etc.).
    - Completed boxscore stats for the prediction game.
    - Post‑decision injury statuses (e.g., final inactives) if present.
    - Any label‑derived columns (rolling accuracy, residuals that use actual labels).
  - **Potentially allowed but time‑sensitive:**
    - Market snapshots.
    - Injury and participation probabilities.
    - Team totals derived from markets.
  - **Safe:**
    - Historical usage aggregates.
    - Pre‑game context (schedule, rest days, travel).
    - Weather forecast as‑of decision time.

**2.2 Strengthen central leak‑guard lists**

- In `utils/general/constants` (or equivalent):
  - Expand `LEAK_PRONE_COLUMNS` to include:
    - Patterns: `*_game`, `*_post`, `*_actual`, `*_label`, `*final*`, `*boxscore*`, etc.
    - Known problematic columns from the inventory.
  - Add a **positive allowlist per problem**:
    - E.g., `ALLOWED_COLUMNS_ANYTIME_TD` which is either:
      - Explicit list of safe prefixes/namespaces; or
      - Rules like “allow `ps_*` but not `*_game` or `*_same_game`”.
- In the feature selection logic during training:
  - Enforce:
    - `features = (raw_features - LEAK_PRONE_COLUMNS) ∩ ALLOWED_COLUMNS(problem)`.
  - Fail fast with a clear error if:
    - Any `LEAK_PRONE_COLUMNS` survive into the training set.
    - Any unlabeled “suspicious” column (matching forbidden patterns) is encountered.

**2.3 Add structural tests for leakage**

- Extend or add tests (e.g., `tests/test_data_leak_guard.py`) to:
  - Build a small training matrix for `anytime_td` with the real pipeline.
  - Assert that:
    - No columns with `_game`, `_same_game`, `_post`, etc. patterns appear.
    - No label column (or obvious transformations like `label_*`) appears in the feature list.
    - PS aliases created explicitly for analysis (`_ps_*_game`) do not show up in `feature_columns`.
  - Include a regression test:
    - Intentionally introduce a fake leak‑prone column in the feature builder and assert the training path fails.

**2.4 Validate as‑of and decision‑time correctness**

- Odds and market snapshots:
  - In `utils/feature/asof.py` / `asof_metadata` and odds feature construction:
    - Verify each `market_anytime_td_*` column is tagged with:
      - A source timestamp (snapshot_ts).
      - The intended horizon (e.g., `24h`, `6h`, `2h`, `open`).
    - Enforce at feature build:
      - `snapshot_ts <= decision_cutoff_ts` for the selected horizon.
      - If a snapshot is missing before cutoff, the corresponding feature is null/flagged as missing.
  - In training configs:
    - Require explicit choice of horizon (e.g., `odds_horizon: 24h`) and use only matching columns.
- Injury and participation:
  - Confirm that:
    - Injury features (`injury_report_status`, `injury_practice_status`, etc.) used for training are the as‑of snapshots, not end‑of‑week statuses.
    - `injury_inactive_probability` is always derived from as‑of injury columns, not from final inactive lists.
- External actuals join:
  - In `_derive_target_column` and any `external_source` join:
    - Confirm that the feature frame already filters by `game_date <= decision_cutoff_date` (or similar) before joining actuals.
    - Add an assertion that:
      - No joined row has a game timestamp > max timestamp in the feature window for that fold.

**2.5 Audit conformal / CV splitting for leakage**

- For `PurgedGroupTimeSeriesSplit` and conformal composite:
  - Verify group structure:
    - Splits ensure that no game’s future weeks leak into its training folds.
    - For per‑player splits, ensure a purge window so labels don’t leak via rolling features.
- Add a test:
  - Simulate toy data with time and group labels.
  - Assert that:
    - Any time window used for test is at least `purge_window` ahead of training rows.

**Risks / pitfalls**

- Over‑aggressive filters may drop genuinely useful features if pattern rules are too broad.
- Market/injury pipelines are complex; small misalignments between training and inference time horizons are easy to miss without explicit assertions.

---

**Phase 3 – Align Features with Real Football Mechanisms**

**3.1 Usage and opportunity features**

Goal: base predictions on how players are actually used in ways that lead to TDs.

- Review existing usage features:
  - Target share (overall, red zone, goal‑to‑go).
  - Carry share (overall, inside 10, goal‑line).
  - Route participation and alignment (slot, wide, inline TE, backfield).
- Implementation steps:
  - Ensure historical aggregates:
    - Are position‑sensible (e.g., RB targets vs WR targets).
    - Use decay/half‑life consistent with plausible coaching adjustments (e.g., stronger weight on last 3–5 games, but include season).
  - Add missing key features where data allows:
    - **Inside‑5 and inside‑10 usage:** counts and shares for carries/targets in these zones.
    - **2‑min drill and hurry‑up targets:** to capture late‑game TD chances for specific roles (e.g., satellite backs, slot receivers).
    - **Red‑zone route participation by alignment:** e.g., fraction of red‑zone routes from slot vs outside for WRs.
- Normalize features:
  - Use team‑relative shares (e.g., red‑zone target share among WRs, RBs) rather than raw counts to better reflect role vs volume.

**3.2 Game‑state‑aware drive features**

- Extend `_finalize_drive_history_features` to:
  - Compute drive history conditional on game state:
    - **Field position buckets:** starting field position, red‑zone starts.
    - **Score differential buckets:** leading, tied, trailing; maybe more granular.
    - **Down & distance types:** short‑yardage vs long; especially near the goal line.
  - Examples:
    - `drive_hist_td_rate_prev_trailing`: TD rate on drives when trailing.
    - `drive_hist_rush_heavy_td_rate_rz`: TD rate on drives in red zone where team skewed run‑heavy.
- Use these features to:
  - Better capture contexts when TDs are more likely and which players are on the field in those contexts.

**3.3 Role flags and packages**

- Revisit `_append_role_flags` and similar role inference logic:
  - For flags like `role_goal_line_back`, `role_primary_red_zone_target`:
    - Condition role determination on the relevant context only:
      - Goal‑line back: share of carries inside the 5 or inside the 3.
      - Primary RZ target: share of RZ targets on passing plays from specific formations (if available).
  - Introduce package‑aware roles if data supports it:
    - e.g., 12 personnel red‑zone specialists vs 11 personnel field stretchers.
- Use quantiles stratified by:
  - Team, position, and context (red zone, goal‑line).
- Add tests:
  - Synthetic player histories where a short‑yardage back only appears in goal‑line situations; assert they are correctly tagged as `role_goal_line_back`.

**3.4 Team context and scoring environment**

- Clean up and NFL‑ize team total / scoring features:
  - Simplify and re‑implement `TeamTotalAdjustedClassifier` for NFL:
    - Use implied team totals from markets plus historical scoring.
    - Remove MLB‑specific innings logic.
  - Build features like:
    - `team_implied_td_total` from spreads and totals.
    - `team_scoring_rate_season` and `red_zone_td_rate_season`.
- Use these as multipliers:
  - Combine team scoring environment with player usage to approximate expected TD opportunities.

**3.5 Injury and playing time expectations**

- Strengthen `injury_inactive_probability` and related features:
  - Confirm transformation in `utils/train/data._augment_injury_signals`:
    - Uses only practice status and injury reports available pre‑decision.
  - Add features:
    - Expected snap share given injury status (e.g., limited practice trend).
    - Positional depth chart signals (if available) indicating likely next‑man‑up.
- Ensure the model:
  - Uses injury probabilities primarily as **availability and volume modifiers**, not as label predictors via hidden leakage (e.g., using final inactive lists).

**Risks / pitfalls**

- Over‑engineering rare context features (e.g., very granular game‑state buckets) may create sparse, noisy features.
- Role flags might misclassify players on small samples; use minimum sample thresholds and fallback to neutral/no role when uncertain.

---

**Phase 4 – Cleanup of Legacy / Hallucinated Structure**

**4.1 Feature tuning CLI (tune_features) – decide: remove or implement**

- Option A (if you want tuning): fully implement.
  - Add a CLI entrypoint to `pipeline/feature.py` that:
    - Accepts `--half-life`, `--shrink-k`, `--crude-window` (or similar).
    - Passes these params through to feature construction functions affecting historical decay and shrinkage.
  - Ensure:
    - `tune_features` in `pipeline/train.py` calls this CLI correctly.
    - The resulting feature matrices are versioned/tagged by their hyper‑parameters.
- Option B (if not needed now): deprecate/remove.
  - Remove or comment out `tune_features` and any config references.
  - Add a note in docs that feature hyper‑parameters are currently fixed and how to change them manually.

**4.2 Remove or confine MLB‑specific artifacts**

- Identify all MLB leftovers:
  - Fields like `inning_topbot`, `game_pk`, MLB‑style conformal meta.
  - MLB‑specific config keys or dataset names.
- For NFL anytime TD paths:
  - Either:
    - Strip these fields from:
      - Meta schemas in conformal/ensemble outputs.
      - Group/ID columns used for splits and stacking.
    - Or wrap them under a generic, unused namespace that is never part of NFL feature selection.
- Add a guard:
  - Tests that building the NFL anytime TD feature matrix and training models:
    - Does not require or reference `inning_*` or `game_pk`.

**4.3 Clean up dangling assumptions (e.g., snap_zero_usage_stub)**

- Search for references to:
  - `snap_zero_usage_stub`.
  - Any other stub/placeholder from prior iterations.
- For each:
  - If no longer used:
    - Delete references and comments, or clearly mark them as deprecated.
  - If still conceptually needed:
    - Re‑implement consistently:
      - Add the stub in `player_game_level` with clear semantics.
      - Ensure tests validate the presence or absence of the stub in features as intended.

**4.4 Normalize naming and IDs**

- Canonicalize `game_id` vs `game_pk` and related IDs:
  - Choose a single canonical internal name for NFL games (`game_id`).
  - Add adapters only at IO boundaries (e.g., when reading external data that uses `game_pk`).
- Refactor training and feature code:
  - Replace ambiguous references with the canonical names.
  - Ensure groupings (for CV, conformal, etc.) use the canonical game and team ids.

**4.5 Documentation and discoverability**

- Add a concise, up‑to‑date overview file (e.g., `docs/anytime_td_pipeline.md`) covering:
  - Label definitions and semantics.
  - High‑level feature groups (usage, odds, injury, PS, drives).
  - Strict rules about leakage and as‑of time handling.
- In the code:
  - Add short docstrings for central entrypoints:
    - Feature builder.
    - Training setup.
    - Prediction CLI.

**Risks / pitfalls**

- Removing legacy elements may break other problem types (e.g., MLB models) if they share code paths.
- Mitigation:
  - Isolate NFL‑specific changes behind configuration flags or separate entrypoints, and run existing ML problems (if any) through basic regression checks.

---

**Phase 5 – Evaluation, Calibration, and Ongoing Safety**

**5.1 Calibration and performance by football segments**

- Implement evaluation slices:
  - By position (RB/WR/TE/QB).
  - By role flags (goal‑line back, primary RZ target, gadget/return).
  - By odds bucket (favorites vs longshots).
  - By game state contexts (high total vs low total games).
- For each slice:
  - Compute:
    - Brier score, log‑loss.
    - Reliability curves (predicted vs actual TD rates).
- Use this to:
  - Identify segments where features or labels misrepresent football reality (e.g., overconfidence for gadget players).

**5.2 No‑odds baseline model**

- Train a variant of the model that:
  - Excludes all market‑derived features (`market_anytime_td_*`, implied team totals from markets, etc.).
  - Uses only usage, context, PS, injury, and schedule features.
- Compare:
  - Performance vs “full” model.
  - Calibration and error patterns.
- Use this to:
  - Confirm that the model provides incremental information beyond the market.
  - Have a fallback when odds are unavailable or unreliable.

**5.3 Continuous leak monitoring**

- For every training run:
  - Save:
    - The feature schema (column list + basic stats).
    - A “leak audit” summary, e.g.:
      - Count of suspicious patterns in feature names.
      - Any columns close to labels or same‑game stats.
  - Optionally implement an automated rule:
    - Fail the run if the audit detects unknown suspicious columns.
- Extend tests to:
  - Run the full training pipeline on a small subset of data regularly in CI.
  - Confirm leak‑guards and feature selections behave as expected.

**5.4 Change management and versioning**

- Version:
  - Label definitions.
  - Major feature set revisions (e.g., introduction of game‑state‑aware drive features).
  - Model architectures and important training configs.
- Maintain a short changelog for anytime TD:
  - Each entry: date, change, rationale, expected impact (e.g., “label now excludes return TDs”).

**Risks / pitfalls**

- Evaluation and monitoring can become noisy if too many slices are tracked without clear thresholds.
- Mitigate by:
  - Prioritizing key slices (e.g., RB goal‑line usage, WR red‑zone roles).
  - Using visual dashboards or a small set of summary metrics.

---

**How an Agent Should Execute This Plan**

- **Start with Phase 1 & 2**: fix label semantics and harden leak‑guards before touching feature additions—these are the highest‑leverage and lowest‑ambiguity changes.
- **Then Phase 3**: refine features aligned with real TD mechanisms, using existing infra and tests to keep complexity manageable.
- **Next Phase 4**: simplify and de‑clutter the codebase, removing dead or misleading paths that make reasoning and debugging harder.
- **Finally Phase 5**: add tests, diagnostics, and calibration tooling so future changes don’t reintroduce leakage or football‑unrealistic behavior.

If you’d like, the next step can be to select a concrete subset of this (e.g., “fix label + leak‑guards only”) and I can outline a file‑by‑file, function‑by‑function implementation checklist for that slice.
    <END_PLAN_END>

    Repository + Git requirements:

    - This repo is under git. At the very beginning of THIS RUN, before editing any files:
        1) Run `git status` to inspect the current state.
        2) If there are uncommitted changes from previous runs, stage and commit them with a concise
           message like `codex: iteration checkpoint` (or a slightly more descriptive variant).
        3) If a remote named `origin` exists and authentication allows, run `git push` so that the
           current state is saved remotely. If push fails due to auth or remote issues, continue with
           local commits only, but do NOT delete history.
        4) Only after ensuring there is a clean commit of the current state should you begin making
           new edits in this run.

    - During this run:
        * Make coherent, incremental commits as you reach logical checkpoints.
        * If you realize that your changes have badly broken the project and you cannot fix them
          cleanly within this run, you may revert to the last good commit (for example, using
          `git reset --hard HEAD` or `git checkout .`), then proceed more conservatively.

    Your tools allow you to:
    - Inspect files in this repo.
    - Edit files.
    - Run shell commands/tests as needed (e.g. project-specific tests, evaluations, or scripts).
    - Use git commands to create commits and, if possible, push them.

    Your goal in THIS RUN:
    - Implement as much of the plan as you reasonably can with high quality.
    - Prioritize correctness, alignment with football reality, and improved model performance
      over speed.
    - Run whatever tests or checks are appropriate to validate your changes.

    At the end of THIS RUN:
    - Give a concise update on your progress.
    - If the ENTIRE plan is fully implemented and validated, include a line with EXACTLY:
        The plan is completely implemented
      (case and spacing exactly as written).
    - If the plan is NOT fully implemented, include a concise progress summary starting with:
        PROGRESS:
      followed by a short description of what you accomplished and what remains.

    Take your time and implement the richest / most complete solution for the pieces you touch in this run.

Here is the progress summary from the last implementation run:

<BEGIN_PROGRESS_FROM_PREVIOUS_RUN>
Blocked immediately: I can’t start the plan because `.git` appears read-only. `git add -A` fails with “Unable to create …/.git/index.lock: Operation not permitted”, and even `touch .git/index.lock` or `chmod -R u+w .git` cannot write to `.git`. This prevents making the required checkpoint commit. Please let me know if I should proceed without the pre-run commit or if you can adjust permissions on the repo so I can stage/commit changes.
<END_PROGRESS_FROM_PREVIOUS_RUN>

Use this to avoid repeating work and to focus on remaining parts of the plan.

**Handling .git permission issues**

**Reporting git directory write blockage**

I’ve realized the .git directory is read-only or restricted, preventing creating or staging commits as the sandbox or environment disallows writes there. Since this blocks the required initial commit step, I can’t proceed with any code changes or fulfill the user’s instructions fully. I’ll inform the user clearly that due to permission issues with the .git folder, I cannot stage or commit changes, thus blocking progress, and suggest they enable write access or address the restriction to move forward.
