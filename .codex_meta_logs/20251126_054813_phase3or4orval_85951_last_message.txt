PROGRESS: Still blocked before edits. `.git` is unwritable (`Operation not permitted` for creating `.git/index.lock` and even `touch .git/permission_test`). `git add -A` fails because index.lock can’t be created. Tried `chflags -R nouchg .git` and `chmod -R u+w .git`, but writes to `.git` remain disallowed. I can’t meet the “commit current state before editing” requirement until `.git` permissions are fixed or that requirement is relaxed.
