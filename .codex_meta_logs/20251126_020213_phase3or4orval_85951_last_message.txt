Blocked right at the start: I’m unable to write inside `.git`, so I can’t stage or commit the existing changes as requested. `git add -A` fails with “Unable to create …/.git/index.lock: Operation not permitted”, and even a simple `touch .git/testfile` is denied. Attempts to adjust permissions (`rm .git/index.lock`, `chflags -R nouchg .git`, `chmod -R u+rw .git`) all hit the same “Operation not permitted” errors. Because your instructions require a clean commit before any new edits, I haven’t made further changes. How would you like to proceed?
