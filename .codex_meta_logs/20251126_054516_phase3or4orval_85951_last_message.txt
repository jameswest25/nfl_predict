PROGRESS: Still blocked at the pre‑work checkpoint. `git add -A` fails with “Unable to create .git/index.lock: Operation not permitted”, and even `touch .git/testwrite` and `chmod -R u+rw .git` are denied across `.git/objects/*`. I can’t create index.lock or write inside `.git`, so I’m unable to stage/commit the existing changes as required before making new edits. Please adjust permissions or move the repo to a location where `.git` is writable, then I can continue with the plan.
