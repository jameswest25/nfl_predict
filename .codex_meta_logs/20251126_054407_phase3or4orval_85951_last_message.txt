PROGRESS: Still blocked at the pre-work checkpoint. I can’t stage/commit because the repo’s `.git` is non-writable (`fatal: Unable to create .git/index.lock: Operation not permitted`). Until `.git` allows writes, I can’t meet the requirement to checkpoint the current state before edits. Please adjust permissions on the repo (at least allow creating `.git/index.lock`) and let me know; I’ll proceed with the plan immediately after.
