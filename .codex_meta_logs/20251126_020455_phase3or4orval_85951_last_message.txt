PROGRESS: Still blocked before any edits. `git status` shows existing unstaged changes, but `git add -A` fails with “Unable to create …/.git/index.lock: Operation not permitted”. I also cannot `touch .git/tmp_test`, so the `.git` directory is not writable in this environment.

I can’t satisfy your requirement to stage/commit the current state before making changes. Please either make `.git` writable or waive the pre-commit requirement so I can proceed with the plan.
