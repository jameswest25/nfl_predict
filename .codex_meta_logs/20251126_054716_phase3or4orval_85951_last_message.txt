PROGRESS: Still blocked at pre-work checkpoint. `git add -A` fails with “Unable to create .git/index.lock: Operation not permitted”; even `touch .git/testwrite` is denied, so the `.git` directory is not writable. Because your instructions require staging/committing the current state before edits, I can’t start implementing the plan. Please adjust permissions or move the repo to a writable location (or relax the “clean commit first” requirement) and let me know when it’s ready.
