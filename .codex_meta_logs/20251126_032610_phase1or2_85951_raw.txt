Context about this project:

- This is a project that takes NFL play-by-play data and uses it for modeling so that we can
  predict which players are likely to get an anytime touchdown (rushing or receiving, not passing)
  in an upcoming game.

- The goal is to build features and models that are as close as possible to the underlying
  football reality that produces touchdowns: play-calling tendencies, player usage, game state,
  defensive matchups, injuries, roles, red-zone behavior, etc.

- Training featurization must conceptually and logically match prediction/inference featurization.
  Anything that can only be known in hindsight at inference time (future data, downstream labels,
  or derived artifacts that use future information) is a form of leakage and must be eliminated.

- Over time, previous model runs and refactors may have left behind:
    * partially-implemented ideas,
    * experimental code paths,
    * hallucinated features,
    * or confusing / inconsistent logic.
  DO NOT assume that all existing code, features, configs, or comments are intentional or correct
  just because they exist. Treat any piece of code or configuration that does not clearly make
  sense in the context of the project as a candidate for cleanup, simplification, or removal.

Your task in this step:

Please analyze the current state of this project (code, data flow, feature engineering, and modeling)
and let me know:

1. Where things conceptually are not implemented correctly or are conceptually off, given the goal of
   predicting anytime TDs in a way that matches how football is actually played.
2. Where the modeling or data flow could be brought closer to "reality" as it actually plays out
  on the field. The goal of getting closer to reality is entirely so that the model is more
  accurate and metrics like AUC or other evaluation metrics improve.
3. Any incomplete implementations, half-finished ideas, or abandoned experimental paths.
4. Any wrong or misleading implementations (especially where names / comments and actual behavior diverge).
5. Any future data leaking into the modeling or feature pipeline (anything that uses knowledge from
  after the prediction cut-off point, including label-derived features).
6. Any underlying data sources or features that appear to not be working at all, or are effectively
  noise / dead weight.
7. Any areas where it looks like a previous run of a model or tool hallucinated structure, concepts,
  or features that don't actually exist in the real data or problem domain.

You should:

- Be concrete and specific in your findings.
- Call out anything that looks like hallucinated or legacy cruft that should probably be removed or
  reworked, instead of assuming it must be intentional.
- Focus on how each issue you find ultimately affects model realism and predictive performance.
