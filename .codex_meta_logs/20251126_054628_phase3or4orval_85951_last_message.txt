PROGRESS: Still blocked at the pre‑work checkpoint. I ran `git status` and confirmed many unstaged changes. `git add -A` still fails with “Unable to create .git/index.lock: Operation not permitted”. Direct writes to `.git` (e.g., `touch .git/index.lock`, `mkdir .git/tmp_test`) also fail with “Operation not permitted”, so I can’t stage/commit as required before editing. Please adjust permissions or move the repo to a writable location so I can proceed with the plan.
