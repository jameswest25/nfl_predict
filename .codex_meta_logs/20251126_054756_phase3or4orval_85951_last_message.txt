PROGRESS: Still blocked before edits. `git add -A` fails with “Unable to create .git/index.lock: Operation not permitted” when trying to stage existing changes; `.git` is not writable under current permissions. I can’t meet your requirement to commit the current state before making changes. Please adjust permissions for `.git` (or relax the clean-commit requirement) and let me know when it’s ready.
