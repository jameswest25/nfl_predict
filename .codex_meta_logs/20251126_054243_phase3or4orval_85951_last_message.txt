Blocked immediately: I can’t start the plan because `.git` appears read-only. `git add -A` fails with “Unable to create …/.git/index.lock: Operation not permitted”, and even `touch .git/index.lock` or `chmod -R u+w .git` cannot write to `.git`. This prevents making the required checkpoint commit. Please let me know if I should proceed without the pre-run commit or if you can adjust permissions on the repo so I can stage/commit changes.
