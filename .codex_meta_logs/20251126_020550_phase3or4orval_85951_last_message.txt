PROGRESS: Still blocked before edits. `git status` shows existing modified/untracked files, but `git add -A` and even `touch .git/tmp_test` fail with “Operation not permitted” (cannot create `.git/index.lock`). Repository’s `.git` appears read-only to this session, so I can’t stage/commit the current state as required. Once `.git` is writable or the pre-commit requirement is waived, I can proceed with the plan.
